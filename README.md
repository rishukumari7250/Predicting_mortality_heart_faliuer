Predicting Mortality Risk in Heart Failure
📊 Overview
This project aims to predict the mortality risk of heart failure patients using various machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of clinical data such as age, gender, blood pressure, ejection fraction, and other medical features. By analyzing these features, the goal is to predict the likelihood of mortality within a specific time frame, helping in early diagnosis and improving patient care.

🧠 Objectives
Predict the mortality risk for heart failure patients based on clinical features

Evaluate different machine learning models for prediction accuracy

Identify the most influential features affecting patient mortality

Provide insights into the correlation between different health parameters and heart failure outcomes

🔍 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset

Features: Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction, etc.

Target Variable: Mortality (1 = Death within time frame, 0 = Survival)

📈 Key Insights
Certain health features, such as serum creatinine and ejection fraction, are highly correlated with mortality risk.

The random forest model showed the best performance in predicting outcomes, with an AUC score of 0.85.

Patients with low ejection fraction and high serum creatinine levels are at significantly higher risk of mortality.
